    "Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features.

    "## 1.9.2. Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "MultinomialNB implements the naive Bayes algorithm for multinomially distributed data, and is one of the two classic naive Bayes variants used in text classification (where the data are typically represented as word vector counts, although tf-idf vectors are also known to work well in practice). **The distribution is parametrized by vectors $\\theta_y = (\\theta_{y1},\\ldots,\\theta_{yn})$ for each class y**, where n is the number of features (in text classification, the size of the vocabulary) and $\\theta_{yi}$ is the probability $P(x_i \\mid y)$ of feature i appearing in a sample belonging to class y.\n",

    "\n",
    "The smoothing priors $\\alpha \\ge 0$ accounts for features not present in the learning samples and prevents zero probabilities in further computations. Setting $\\alpha = 1$ is called **Laplace smoothing**, while $\\alpha < 1$ is called **Lidstone smoothing**.\n",

    "BernoulliNB implements the naive Bayes training and classification algorithms for data that is distributed according to multivariate Bernoulli distributions; i.e., there may be multiple features but each one is assumed to be a binary-valued (Bernoulli, boolean) variable. Therefore, **this class requires samples to be represented as binary-valued feature vectors**; if handed any other kind of data, a BernoulliNB instance may binarize its input (depending on the binarize parameter).\n",

    "In the case of text classification, word occurrence vectors (rather than word count vectors) may be used to train and use this classifier. `BernoulliNB` might perform better on some datasets, especially those with shorter documents. It is advisable to evaluate both models, if time permits.\n",

    "Naive Bayes models can be used to tackle large scale classification problems for which the full training set might not fit in memory. To handle this case, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB, and GaussianNB expose a `partial_fit` method that can be used incrementally as done with other classifiers as demonstrated in Out-of-core classification of text documents. All naive Bayes classifiers support sample weighting.\n",
